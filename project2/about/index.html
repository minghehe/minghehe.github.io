	My name is Minghe Hu. My major is Communications, specialized in Journalism of Technology and Business, and I am currently
	on my last year at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT).
	My home country is China. I grew up in a dessert area, where the blue sky and loess are so remarkable and pure that
	I could not find any other place like it. From a place that can not even be found in Chinese map, I moved to cities that
	are much bigger and crowded. I started the journey to looking for myself and exploring the world. Different cultures did not
	scare me. Experience abroad always reached me more. It made me learn more about myself and encourage me to keep going on.

	<p>
	I got used to live in different cities, thus it did not make me feel hesitated when I got the chance to go to Spain.
	On the coast of Mediterranean, I learned that there are other beauties in the other world.
	More important is that I want to know them. During this time, I studied Spanish language and literature. I made
	many friends and got experiences that I will carry with me for my whole life. As it was the first time I was living
	far from home, I had to do all things by myself. I learned how to manage my own money and make my own decisions.
	It was the closest I got of independence by that time.

	I came to US after left Europe, similar feeling but different world.
	This world is modern and diversified. In IIT, I took inspirational classes, like the Interprofessional Projects Program (IPRO),
	where I had the opportunity to work on the development of a solution for a real-world problem. The research was done under the theme of
	air pollution reduction. As a result of the hardwork that me and my teammates did, the project was awarded as the the
	best one in IPRO Social Innovation Showcase. Things like this make me feel very confident that I am on the right track, and also
	make me want to do more.
	After I graduate from IIT, I intend to do masters and, eventually, get a doctor degree as well. I believe that keep studying is
	essential nowadays, because everything is changing really fast. To be a successful journalist, I know I have to keep up with
	everything, and I am ready for it.
	</p>

	<p>
	To be a journalist, is not only a dream job for me from childhoood, also it fits me more and more during the education and experience
	I am having. I made friends in Paris, Barcelona. I walked on the streets of Rio de Janeiro and Chicago. I am curious about the life
	of people and I want to help people to make their own voice, to confront the barrier of boundary between countries and have a fairly
	happy life like everyone of us deserve. I strongly feel that I am part of the world more than ever before.

	Diversity of knowledge and broad cultural vision is what I need.
	Getting to know how a web is designed is from my interests and the necessity from my future profession.
	This course will be a challenge for me. However, life is full of uncertainty.
	Challenge would just be another station.
